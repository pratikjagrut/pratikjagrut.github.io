    "body": "• Contents   \u0026emsp; Go is an open-source, statically typed, compiled programing language built by Google. It combines the simplest of both statically typed and dynamically typed languages and provides you with the proper mixture of efficiency and simple programming. It is primarily fitted to building fast, efficient, and reliable server-side or system applications.\nFollowing are some noted features of Go -\n Safety Concurrency Efficient Garbage Collection High-speed compilation Excellent Tooling support  Installing GO Go binary distributions are available for all major operating systems like Linux, Windows, and macOS. It’s easy to install Go from the binary distributions or you can try installing Go from source.\nLinux   Download Go for Linux from Go’s official download page.\ntar -xvf go1.15.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz It will create a directory named go.\n  Move that dir to /usr/local where all other binaries reside.\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin   Custom Installation directory\nInstead of moving dir to /usr/local you can choose any other dir.\nmv go $HOME/ Then set this custom location to GOROOT environment variable.\nexport GOROOT=$HOME/go To make GOROOT permanent add it to .bashrc or .zshrc depending on which shell you are using or else your GOROOT will be unset once you end your terminal session or start a new terminal session.\n  MacOS X Install GO in MacOS using Homebrew.\nbrew install go Windows Download the Windows installer from Go’s official download page. Open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Go. By default, the installer installs Go in C:\\Go.\nOnce installed try go version to check the installation.\nGo Code organization  Note: After the introduction of Go modules in Go 1.11, its no longer required to store Go code in the Go workspace. You can create your Go project in any directory outside of GOPATH. You can refer to go docs on code organization. The following Go Code organization is still widely in use mostly because of its elegant organizing structure. \nWorkspace Go requires you to organize your code in a specific way -\nBy convention, all your Go code and the code must reside in a single workspace whose path is stored in the environment variable GOPATH.\nThe workspace dir is supposed to contain the following sub-dir:\n  src: contains Go source files.\nThe src directory typically contains many version control repositories containing one or more Go packages. Every Go source file belongs to a package. You generally create a new subdirectory inside your repository for every separate Go package. The tree for this looks like the following:\ngo └── src └── github.com ├── pratikjagrut │ └── go-tutorial │ └── helloworld │ └── main.go └── user └── project   bin: contains the executable binaries.\nThe Go tool builds and installs executable binaries to this directory.\n  pkg: contains Go package archives.\nAll the non-executable packages (shared libraries) are stored in this directory. This is typically imported and used inside other executable packages.\n  Setting GOPATH Linux and macOS mkdir $HOME/go_workspace export GOPATH=$HOME/go_workspace To make GOPATH permanent add it to .bashrc or .zshrc depending on which shell you are using or else your GOPATH will be unset once you end your terminal session or start a new terminal session.\nWindows System   Create the workspace folder at C:\\go-workspace.\n  Right-click on Start → click Control Panel → Select System and Security → click on System.\n  From the menu on the left, select the Advanced system\u0026rsquo;s settings.\n  Click the Environment Variables button at the bottom.\n  Click New from the User variables section.\n  Type GOPATH into the Variable name field.\n  Type C:\\go-workspace into the Variable value field.\n  Click OK.\n  Note: GOPATH must be different than the path of your Go installation.\n• Contents   \u0026emsp; Github Repo   \u0026emsp; \u0026#128279; Reference  ",
